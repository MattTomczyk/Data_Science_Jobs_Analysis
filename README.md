# Data_Science_Jobs_Analysis
This project aims to demonstrate my fundamental skills in data analytics on a large data set of occupational information

The raw .csv file is included (data_science_job.csv) as well as the jupyter notebook file. The data set was found on Kaggle.com. To run properly, ensure that the correct file location is incorporated into the code
Please download and open the .html file in a browser to view a visualization of the jupyter file. 

Thanks!
